# Chessonator
Chessonator is the chess AI game with some really cool additional features. It can provide feedback to the user in written English during the game. These are the examples of feedback requests: "Why did the opponent make this move?", "What move should I make? (and why)", "Was that a strong move? (and why)", "What other move could I make? (and why)".
